## Description

Metaflix is a light-hearted take on a streaming service web page. It includes the following features:

- A humorous message in a modal dialog.
- A header with options for language selection and signing in (which doesn't do anything in this case).
- A section promoting "Unlimited movies, TV shows, and more" with a signup form (which also doesn't have real functionality).
- Features section with text and images promoting various features (watching on TV, downloading shows, watching everywhere, creating profiles for children).
- A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section with expandable answers.
- A footer with links to FAQ, investor relations, privacy, and more.

Please note that this web page is designed for fun and parody and does not provide any actual streaming content.
